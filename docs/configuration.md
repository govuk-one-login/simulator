## Configuration

### Setting up configuration:

The client, response and error configuration for the simulator can be set up in one of two ways:

1. Using environment variables - These are best suited for static configuration, which shouldn't change frequently
2. Making a POST request to the `/config` endpoint to update the configuration - This is best for configuration which will be frequently updated

**Note: The `/config` endpoint will overwrite any fields set as environment variables whilst the docker container is running.**

Parameters provided as environment variables that are parsed as an array should be set as a comma separated string, for example:
`CLIENT_LOCS=P0,P2`

Where values are not provided for the configuration, [default values](#default-configuration-values) will be used. Some provided configuration fields may be ignored if they are not valid.

### Getting the current configuration:

To get the current configuration of the simulator, a GET request can be made to the `/config` endpoint. This returns the client configuration, response configuration and error configuration, as well as the url the simulator is running on, in the body of the response.

### Client Configuration

The table below describes the different fields for the client configuration. When updating the client config using the `/config` endpoint, the following JSON structure is required in the request body:

```json
{
  "clientConfiguration": {
    "clientId": "aClientId",
    "scopes": ["openid", "phone", "email"],
    ...other fields
  },
}
```

### Response Configuration:

The table below describes the different fields for the response configuration. When updating the response config using the `/config` endpoint, the following JSON structure is required in the request body:

```json
{
  "responseConfiguration": {
    "sub": "someSubjectIdentifier",
    "email": "anExampleEmail@example.com" ,
    ...other fields
  },
}
```

Some response configuration fields are not available to be set as environment variables.

| returnCodes                       | A set of return codes to be returned if the return code claim is included in the client configuration and `/authorize` request.

Where the above valid values are JSON objects/JSON arrays, no further validation is done on the provided response configuration unless outlined. You should consult the technical docs for examples of what these fields should look like.

#### URL configuration:

You may wish to deploy the simulator and you can therefore configure the URL at which the simulator is hosted. This is done via the environment variable: `SIMULATOR_URL`.
Alternatively the url can be updated using the `/config` endpoint with the following request body field:

```json
{
  "simulatorUrl": "https://example.com/deployed-simulator"
}
```

**Note: When modifying the simulator URL, this will affect the other endpoints and any validation that includes these endpoints.**

> For example: The token endpoint will become`${SIMULATOR_URL}/token`, so the expected audience of the client assertion should be updated to reflect this.

#### Mutually exclusive configuration values:

Some features of the simulator are not available to be enabled together. In these cases the simulator will throw an error describing the invalid configuration. These are also listed below:

- Identity Verification Enabled **must** be set to `false` when the Token Authentication mechanism is set to `client_secret_post`.
